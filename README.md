# visitor-counting-system-
This project is an IR-based visitor counter using Arduino and an OLED display. It uses two IR sensors to detect people entering and exiting a room. The current number of people is shown live on the OLED screen. A buzzer alerts when someone enters or exits. This project is ideal for smart doorways and IoT-based automation.
